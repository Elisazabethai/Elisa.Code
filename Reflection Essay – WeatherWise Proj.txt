Reflection Essay – WeatherWise Project 
Elizabeth Mathemabi | ISYS2001 – Introduction to Business Programming 

The WeatherWise project has been a meaningful learning journey that challenged me to grow as both a developer and a creative thinker. I learned new programming skills while addressing real-world problems and working with artificial intelligence tools, making the experience enriching and enjoyable. In this reflection, I discuss the tools used, prompting strategies applied, things that worked well, places for improvement, and my final thoughts on the learning experience.

For the successful completion of this project, I mainly used ChatGPT as an AI assistant. Throughout the project, it has been a reliable tool, helping me better understand Python programming concepts, and helping me develop and improve my code. ChatGPT helped me structure my functions, debug my code, create visualisations, and came up with comments for the natural language component of the project. I explored GitHub Copilot though I leaned on ChatGPT more for deeper explanations and reflective support. These tools aided in practical matters and fostered a mindset of independence concerning my issues. 

In my interaction with AI, I used various intentional prompting techniques. One prominent technique I applied was stepwise help-seeking. So, instead of asking a general question, I would ask something like, "How can I modularise this code in three steps?" It aided my understanding of the logic of each function. I also made comparisons between the before-and-after states of functions to develop them further, and I would ask ChatGPT to play the role of a tutor, giving simple explanations. Furthermore, I would storm prompts with edge cases to help ensure my program handled unexpected inputs properly. These prompting strategies allowed me to exert control over AI interactions and allowed me to learn in a deeper sense. 

Some of my proudest accomplishments in the project were the menu interface built using pyinputplus. It was pleasant to use, easy to navigate, and provided good feedback. I am also proud of the NLP component of the system, which allowed users to ask casual weather questions and getting understandable answers. This helped to create a far more human, interactive feel to the system. 

Given more time, I wanted to implement a GUI to give the system a modern and appealing look. Voice interaction would have added accessibility and sophistication to WeatherWise. I would have spent a bit longer exploring the hands-on-ai package for further intelligent features.

In conclusion, the WeatherWise project aided in my realization that I can solve real problems through programming and AI. It was beyond writing code; it was about learning to work smart, communicate clearly, and create value for users. I learned that AI, while very useful, should not be deemed as a shortcut, but rather as a tool to facilitate one's own educational approach and comprehension. This project also instilled in me greater confidence in my coding ability and reinforced my plans for pursuing a career in technology and business. WeatherWise is not just a weather app; it is solid evidence that I am growing and learning while being ready for the future.
