## AI Tools Used
For the development of Weatherwise, I primarily used ChatGPT as my main AI support tool. It functioned like a digital assistant, helping me debug issues, brainstorm ideas, and refine the overall logic of my program. I also explored GitHub Copilot briefly for auto-suggestions, but ChatGPT offered more relevant and explanatory support.
ChatGPT helped me:
•	Break down complex coding tasks into manageable steps
•	Reorganize my functions to follow a modular design
•	Improve the clarity and readability of my code
•	Suggest improvements for error handling and user interaction
•	Provide creative solutions to unexpected problems during development
Overall, it served as both a coding assistant and a learning partner.


## Prompting Techniques
Throughout the project, I applied several intentional prompting strategies to get the most from AI. These included:
•	Step-by-step prompting: Asking for breakdowns of large problems into smaller tasks
•	Before-and-after comparisons: Sharing my code and asking for improvements
•	Role-based prompting: Asking the AI to act as a Python tutor to explain complex topics
•	Edge case testing: Asking how to prepare the program for unusual or invalid user inputs
•	Reflective prompts: Requesting feedback on design decisions and logic
These methods helped me avoid generic answers and instead receive responses tailored to the specific needs of my project.

## What Worked Well?
One of the parts I am most proud of is the design of my menu-based interface using the pyinputplus library. The menu is clear, intuitive, and handles invalid inputs gracefully. It offers users a guided experience rather than leaving them confused or stuck.
Another area of success was the natural language component. I was able to design a system that interprets simple weather-related questions from users and responds in a natural and human-like way. This gave the project a more interactive and intelligent feel.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would explore building a graphical user interface (GUI) to replace the current text-based interface. A visual design would improve the overall user experience, especially for those unfamiliar with programming environments.
Additionally, I would invest more time into using the hands-on-ai package to enrich the natural language capabilities of the program. Although I briefly explored it, I was unable to fully integrate it due to time constraints.

## Final Thoughts
Completing the Weatherwise project has been a meaningful experience. I have not only developed my technical skills but also built confidence in using AI as a collaborative tool. This project showed me how programming can be both creative and structured, and how important it is to focus on the user’s experience when designing technology.
Most importantly, I learned that using AI tools does not mean bypassing learning. When used thoughtfully, AI can enhance understanding and speed up development without compromising the integrity of the work. I am proud of what I have built and confident in my ability to take on more complex projects in the future.
